_**RISC-V to x86-64 binary translator**_

The rv8 binary translation engine works by interpreting code while
profiling it for hot paths. Hot paths are translated on the fly to
native code. The translation engine maintains a call stack to allow
runtime inlining of hot functions. A jump target cache is used to
accelerate returns and indirect calls through function pointers.
The translator supports hybrid binary translation and interpretation
to handle instructions that do not have native translations.
Currently ‘IM’ code is translated and ‘AFD’ is interpreted. The
translator supports RVC compressed code.

The rv8 binary translator supports a number of simple optimisations:

- Hybrid interpretation and compilation of hot code paths
- Incremental translation with dynamic trace linking
- Inline caching of function calls in hot code paths
- L1 jump target cache for indirect calls and returns
- Macro-op fusion for common RISC-V instruction sequences

_**RISC-V full system emulator**_

The rv8 suite includes a full system emulator that implements the
RISC-V privileged ISA with support for interrupts, MMIO (memory
mapped input output) devices, a soft MMU (memory management unit)
with separate instruction and data TLBs (translation lookaside
buffers). The full system emulator has a simple integrated debugger
that allows setting breakpoints, single stepping and disassembling
instructions as they are executed.

The rv8 full system emulator has the following features:

- RISC-V IMAFD Base plus Privileged ISA (riscv32 and riscv64)
- Simple integrated debug command line interface
- Histograms (instruction and program counter frequency)
- Soft MMU supporting sv32, sv39, sv48 page translation modes
- Abstract MMIO device interface for device emulation
- Extensible interpreter generated from ISA metadata
- Protected address space

_**RISC-V user mode simulator**_

The rv8 user mode simulator is a single address space
implementation of the RISC-V ISA that implements the RISC-V
Linux syscall ABI (application binary interface) and delegates
system calls to the underlying native host operating system.
The user mode simulator can run RISC-V Linux binaries on non-Linux
operating systems via system call emulation. The current user mode
simulator implements a small number of system calls to allow
running RISC-V Linux ELF static binaries.

The rv8 user mode simulator has the following features:

- RISC-V IMAFD Base ISA (riscv32 and riscv64)
- Simple integrated debug command line interface
- A small set of emulated Linux system calls for simple file IO
- Extensible interpreter generated from ISA metadata
- Instruction logging mode for tracing program execution 
- Shared address space
  - `0x000000000000 - 0x000000000fff` (zero)
  - `0x000000001000 - 0x7ffdffffffff` (guest)
  - `0x7ffe00000000 - 0x7fffffffffff` (host)

_**RISC-V instruction set metadata**_

The `rv-meta` tool is able to generate opcode maps, instruction
decoders, source, headers and instruction set listing LaTeX
from ISA metadata. The following is an example of PDF output:

### Getting Started

Please read the RISC-V toolchain installtion instructions in the
[riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/)
repository.

_Building riscv-gnu-toolchain_

```
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git
$ cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv/toolchain
$ make
```

rv8 has minimum external dependencies besides a C++14 compiler,
the C++ standard libraries and the `asmjit` submodule.

- gcc-5.4 or clang-3.4 (Linux minimum)
- gcc-6.3 or clang-3.8 (Linux recommended)

_Building rv8_

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rv8-io/rv8.git
$ cd rv8
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

_Running rv8_

The `riscv64-unknown-elf` newlib toolchain is required for building
the rv8 test cases and this build step depends on the `RISCV`
environment variable.

```
$ cd rv8
$ export RISCV=/opt/riscv/toolchain
$ make test-build
$ make test-sim
$ make test-sys
$ rv-jit build/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/test-dhrystone
```

### Optimisations

The rv8 binary translator performs JIT (Just In Time) translation
of RISC-V code to X86-64 code. This is a challenging problem for
many reasons; with the principle challange due to RISC-V having
31 integer registers while x86-64 has only 16 integer registers.

_Register allocation_

rv8 solves the register set size problem by spilling registers
to memory (L1 cache) using a static register allocation (a future
versions may use dynamic register allocation). A large amount of
performance is lost due to register allocations that take advantage
of the larger number of physically available registers with less
frequent stack spills. It is not possible for the translator to
rearrange memory and registers for optimal stack spills as memory
accesses must be translated precisely. The additional registers are
translated as x86-64 memory operands (which produce load and store
micro-ops) or in some circumstances, explicit `mov` instructions.

_Translator temporaries_

The rv8 binary translator needs to use a few host registers to
point to translator internal structures and for use as temporary
registers for the emulation of various instructions, for example
a store instructions require the use of two temporary registers
if both register operands are in the spill area. The translator
uses the following x86-64 host registers as temporaries leaving
12 registers available for mapping to RISC-V registers:

- `rbp` - pointer to the register spill area and jump target cache
- `rsp` - pointer to the host stack to allow procedure calls
- `rax` - translator temporary register
- `rcx` - translator temporary register

_Indirect call acceleration_

Indirect calls through function pointers cannot be statically
translated as the target address of their translation is not
known at the time of translation. rv8 employs a trace cache
which is a hashtable of guest program address to translated native
code address. A full trace cache lookup is slow because it
necessitates saving caller-save registers and calling into C++
code. To accelerate indirect calls through function pointers,
a small assembly stub looks up the target address in a direct
mapped L1 translation cache, and only then falls back to a slower
translation cache miss path that saves registers and calls into
the translator code to populate the L1 translation cache so that
the next indirect call can be accelerated.

_Inline caching_

Returns also make use of the L1 translation cache, however any
procedure call that is made inside of a hot trace can be inlined
and to do so the translator maintains a call stack. Upon
reaching an inlined procedures `RET` (_jalr zero, ra_)
instruction, the link register is compared against the callers
kown return address and if it matches, control flow continues
along the return path. In the case that the function is not
inlined, the regular L1 translation cache is used to lookup
the address of the translated code.

_Branch tail linking_

The translator performs lazy translation of the source program
during tracing and when it reaches branches, it can only link
both sides of the branch if there exists an existing translation
for the not taken side of the branch. To accelerate _branch
tail exits_, the translator  emits a relative branch to a
trampoline function that returns to the tracer main loop and
adds the branch to a table of branch fixup addresses indexed
by target guest address. If the branch target is hot, after
if has been translated, all relative branches that point to
tail exit trampolines will be relinked to branch directly
to the translated native code.

_Macro-op fusion_

The rv8 translator implements an optimisation known as macro-op
fusion whereby specific patterns of adjacent instructions are
translated into a single host instruction. The macro-op fusion
pattern matcher has potential to increase performance further
with the addition of common patterns. The following is a list
of macro-op fusion patterns that rv8 currently implements:

- `AUIPC rs, imm20; ADDI rd, rs1, imm12;` (where `rd=rs1`)
  - PC-relative address is resolved using a single `MOV` instruction.
- `AUIPC t0, imm20; JALR ra, imm12(t0);` (where `rd=rs1`)
  - Target address is constructed using a single `MOV` instruction.
- `AUIPC ra, imm20; JALR ra, imm12(ra);` (where `rd=rs1`)
  - Target address register write is elided.
- `SLLI rd, rs1, 32; SRLI rd, rs1, 32` (where `rd=rs1`)
  - Fused into a single `MOVZX` instruction.
- `ADDIW rd, rs1, imm12; SLLI rd, rs1, 32; SRLI rd, rs1, 32`
  (where `rd=rs1`)
  - Fused into 32-bit zero extending `ADD` instruction.

_Sign extension versus zero extension_

In addition to the register allocation problem, rv8 has to make
sure that 32-bit operations on registers are sign extended instead
of zero-extended. The normal behaviour of 32-bit operations on
x86-64 is to zero extend bit 31 to bit 63. It may be possible
in a future version of the JIT translation engine to elide
redundant sign extension operations, however it is important
that the register state precisely matches before executing an
instruction that may cause a fault e.g. loads and stores.

_Bit manipulation intrinsics_

Finally the bencharks below contain digest algorithms and ciphers
which can take advantage of bit manipulation instructions such as
rotate and bswap. Present day compilers are sophisticated enough
to detetc rotate and byte swap logical operations and translate
them into x86-64 bit manipulation instructions (`ROR`, `ROL`,
`BSWAP`). RISC-V currently lacks bit manipulation instructions
however there are proposals to add them in the B extension.

- _Rotate right or left pattern (2 shifts, 1 and)_
  - `(rs1 >> shamt) | (rs1 << (64 - shamt))`
- _32-bit integer byteswap pattern (4 constants, 4 shifts, 4 ands, 3 ors)_
  - `((rs1 >> 24) & 0x000000ff) | ((rs1 << 8 ) & 0x00ff0000) |
    ((rs1 >> 8 ) & 0x0000ff00) | ((rs1 << 24) & 0xff000000)`

_Conclusion_

The combination of the register allocation problem, sign extension
and the lack of bit manipulation intrinsics account for a large
proportion of the difference in instruction count and performance
between native x86-64 code and translated RISC-V code.

### Tracing

The `rv-jit` program supports the ability to log RISC-V instructions
along with the dynamically translated x86-64 assembly and machine code
(`--log-jit-trace`). This mode is useful for JIT translation debugging
and optimisation analysis.

_Sample output from `rv-jit` with the `--log-jit-trace` option_

```
	# 0x0000000000103d70	addi        a0, zero, 1
		mov r8, 1                               ; 41B801000000
		L3:
	# 0x0000000000103d74	slli        a0, a0, 28
		shl r8, 1C                              ; 49C1E01C
		L4:
	# 0x0000000000103d78	addi        a1, zero, -1
		mov r9, FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF                ; 49C7C1FFFFFFFF
		L5:
	# 0x0000000000103d7c	sb          a1, 0(a0)
		rex mov byte [r8], r9b                  ; 458808
		L6:
	# 0x0000000000103d80	lbu         a2, 0(a0)
		movzx r10d, byte [r8]                   ; 450FB610
		L7:
```

### Histograms

The `rv-sim` and `rv-sys` programs support the ability to record and
print histograms. Program counter frequency (`--pc-usage-histogram`),
dynamic instruction frequency (`--instruction-usage-histogram`) and
dynamic register usage (`--register-usage-histogram`) is supported.

The `rv-bin` program via the `histogram` subcommand has the ability
to print static instruction frequency and static register usage.

_Sample output from `rv-sim` with the `--register-usage-histogram`
and `--instruction-usage-histogram` options_

```
$ rv-sim --register-usage-histogram \

### Building and running Linux

Please read the RISC-V toolchain installtion instructions in the
[riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/)
repository. The `riscv64-unknown-elf` newlib toolchain is required
for building the rv8 test cases and the `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu`
glibc toolchain is required for building `busybox` which is used to
create the Linux image that runs in the full system emulator.

The toolchain script will download any required dependencies.

_Building riscv-gnu-toolchain_ for linux

```
$ cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
$ make linux
```

The linux build script will download any required dependencies.

_Building linux, busybox and bbl-lite_

```
$ cd rv8
$ export RISCV=/opt/riscv/toolchain
$ export PATH=${PATH}:${RISCV}/bin
$ make linux
```

To start linux, we execute `bbl` (the Berkeley Boot Loader) which
performs early machine set up and then passes control to an
embedded linux kernel. After kernel initialisation, `busybox` is
then executed from the initramfs as pid 1 (init). The linux image
and the initramfs are combined together and linked into bbl as
the boot payload.

_Running the full system emulator_

```
